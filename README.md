# President's API

A backend service for researchers, historians and hobbyists to request information on each presidential administration. The kinds of things I envision for this API: 

* get number of executive orders by president/administration
* get number of judicial nominations by president/administration; number of judicial nominations successfully approved by congress
* stream original/primary source text pertaining to the executive such as speeches, transcripts, intel, memoranda and other publicly available private correspondence
